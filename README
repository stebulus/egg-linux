Egg Linux

"A penguin is an egg's way of making another egg."

This is a small reproducible and self-reproducing Linux distribution.

How to use:

1. Fetch package sources:

    find package -name sources -execdir wget -nc -i {} +

   To check that all sources were downloaded, run this command again;
   when all sources are present, it will only emit lines of the form
   `File ‘...’ already there; not retrieving.`

2. Build:

    ./hatch x

3. Install to a USB key (on device file USBDEV):

    dd if=/dev/zero of=USBDEV bs=1M count=1
    parted USBDEV
      mklabel gpt
      mkpart primary 1MB 2MB
      set 1 bios_grub on
      mkpart primary ext2 2MB 100%
    mke2fs -t ext2 USBDEV2
    mount USBDEV2 /mnt
    cp -aT x/tree /mnt
    chown -R root:root /mnt
    grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot USBDEV
    umount /mnt

4. Boot from that USB key.  The init is bash.

5. If you want to test that it can reproduce itself, then build it
from that bash:

    export PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin
    mount -o remount,rw /
    /usr/src/egg/hatch /tmp/y

6. If you like, let me know how it went: run

    ./build-report YOURNAME . x /tmp/egg-build-report

and then open a PR at https://github.com/stebulus/egg-linux-build-reports
to add the contents of `/tmp/egg-build-report`.
